# Development Journal
## Tue May 30 2:00pm
  * Went over project requirements, Started OneNote journal for brainstorming and writing copy for the website, explored different websites online for inspiration. 
## Sat Jun 3 7pm
  * Wrote some copy for the website, got started thinking about website structure. I'm going with a single page design for simplicity. 
    - Simple navbar, maybe hamburger menu
    - maybe start with some kind of splash page/animation, then scroll down
  * Looked at different examples of splash pages online. I want something that is within my skillset, not looking to spend too much time learning this
  * Started looking at fonts
    - discovered I can use fontawesome for contact icons
    - used favicon.io for favicon
## Sun Jun 4
  * Picked some colors for a nice teal color scheme
  * Decided on an overlay menu for the navigation bar, will need to do more research
    - Idea for particle effect for the splash page with https://redstapler.co/particles-js-tutorial/
    - Idea for hamburger menu inspired by the CSS animations https://jonsuh.com/hamburgers/
